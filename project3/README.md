# LL(1) Parser

## Introduction

An LL(1) parser is a top-down parser for a subset of context-free grammars. The "LL" signifies that it reads input from Left to right and produces a Leftmost derivation, while the "(1)" indicates it uses one lookahead symbol to make parsing decisions. LL(1) parsers are efficient and straightforward to implement, making them suitable for many practical programming language parsing needs.

## First and Follow Sets

### First Set

The First set of a non-terminal symbol in a grammar is the set of terminals that begin the strings derivable from the non-terminal. To compute the First set, follow these steps:

1. **Initialization**:
    - For each terminal `t`, `FIRST(t) = { t }`.
    - For each non-terminal `N`, initialize `FIRST(N) = {}`.
2. **Rules Application**:
    - For each production `A -> α`:
        - If `α` is a terminal, add `α` to `FIRST(A)`.
        - If `α` is a non-terminal `B`, add `FIRST(B)` to `FIRST(A)`.
        - If `α` is a sequence of symbols `X1 X2 ... Xn`, add `FIRST(X1)` to `FIRST(A)`.
        - If `ε` (the empty string) can be derived from `X1`, then add `FIRST(X2)` to `FIRST(A)`, and so on.
    - Repeat until no more changes occur.

#### First Set for Sequences (X1X2...Xn)

To compute the First set for a sequence of symbols `X1 X2 ... Xn`:

1. **Initialization**:
    - Initialize `FIRST(X1 X2 ... Xn) = {}`.
2. **Sequence Rule Application**:
    - For each symbol `Xi` in the sequence:
        - Add all non-ε elements of `FIRST(Xi)` to `FIRST(X1 X2 ... Xn)`.
        - If `ε` is in `FIRST(Xi)`, continue to the next symbol in the sequence.
        - If `ε` is not in `FIRST(Xi)`, stop and do not consider further symbols.
    - If all symbols in the sequence can derive ε, add ε to `FIRST(X1 X2 ... Xn)`.

### Follow Set

The Follow set of a non-terminal symbol in a grammar is the set of terminals that can appear immediately to the right of the non-terminal in some "sentential" form. To compute the Follow set, follow these steps:

1. **Initialization**:
    - For the start symbol `S`, add `$` (end of input marker) to `FOLLOW(S)`.
    - For each non-terminal `N`, initialize `FOLLOW(N) = {}`.
2. **Rules Application**:
    - For each production `A -> αBβ`:
        - Add `FIRST(β) - {ε}` to `FOLLOW(B)`.
        - If `β` is ε or `β` can derive ε, add `FOLLOW(A)` to `FOLLOW(B)`.
    - Repeat until no more changes occur.

## Parsing Process

The parsing process for an LL(1) parser involves using a parsing table constructed from the First and Follow sets. Here’s the step-by-step procedure:

1. **Construct the Parsing Table**:
    - For each production `A -> α`, for each terminal `t` in `FIRST(α)`, add `A -> α` to `M[A, t]`.
    - If ε is in `FIRST(α)`, for each terminal `b` in `FOLLOW(A)`, add `A -> α` to `M[A, b]`.
    - If ε is in `FIRST(α)` and `$` is in `FOLLOW(A)`, add `A -> α` to `M[A, $]`.

2. **Parsing Algorithm**:
    - Initialize the stack with the start symbol and the end marker `$`.
    - Repeat until the stack is empty:
        - Let `X` be the top symbol of the stack.
        - If `X` is a terminal:
            - If `X` matches the current input symbol, pop `X` from the stack and move the input pointer to the next symbol.
            - Otherwise, report an error.
        - If `X` is a non-terminal:
            - Consult the parsing table `M[X, a]`, where `a` is the current input symbol.
            - If the entry is a production `X -> α`, pop `X` from the stack and push the symbols of `α` in reverse order.
            - If the entry is empty, report an error.
    - If the stack is empty and all input is consumed, the input string is successfully parsed.

By following these algorithms and procedures, an LL(1) parser can be constructed to parse a given input string according to a specific grammar.
